## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

### Favorite Apps and Features
1. **Spotify**
   - Personalized playlists based on listening habits.
   - Offline mode for music playback without an internet connection.

2. **Instagram**
   - Story feature to share short-lived photos and videos.
   - Explore page for discovering new content and accounts.

3. **Notion**
   - Flexible note organization with drag-and-drop capabilities.
   - Collaboration features for real-time team editing.

4. **Duolingo**
   - Gamified language learning with streaks and rewards.
   - Bite-sized lessons for easy learning on the go.

5. **Google Maps**
   - Real-time navigation with traffic updates.
   - The ability to save favorite locations and access them offline.

### App Idea
I would like to build an app called **"Moodify"**, which allows users to set the mood of their environment through interactive visuals and sounds. The app would include features such as:
- A library of ambient soundtracks and animations (e.g., rain, ocean waves, fireplace).
- The ability to combine multiple sounds and visuals to create a customized "mood profile."
- Integration with smart lights (like Philips Hue) to synchronize room lighting with the selected mood.
- A timer feature to set mood sessions for relaxation, study, or sleep.

This app aims to enhance users' environments by creating personalized atmospheres for productivity, relaxation, or mindfulness.


## Notes

One challenge I encountered while building the app was:
- Understanding how to properly use the `UIColor` class to generate random colors. I resolved this by researching `UIColor.random` examples online.
