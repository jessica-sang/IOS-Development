## Notes

During development, I encountered challenges with:
- **Ensuring the UI updated correctly after restarting the game**  
- **Handling question index updates to prevent incorrect looping**  
- **Debugging `performSegue` issues when transitioning to the results screen**  

Through debugging and careful step-by-step testing, these issues were successfully resolved.
